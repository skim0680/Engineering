            1/19/24 - Happy New Year! Last week, we learned about chemical engineering and made Non-Newtonian Fluid. Ours was purple! It was quite fun. This week, we were introduced to our quarter project of creating a car. Jocelyn and I chose the Arduino car, and we are quite worried because neither of us know much about computer science or electrical engineering. We don't know how to go about it yet, but we are working on our project proposal and it is going well so far. We took the chemical engineering quiz today and I think I did good. We also made a new page for our second semester entries. My dog in the picture at the top died in November last year, so it's sad to look at the picture, but I will keep it.

            1/26/24 - This week we started our car project. We are having much difficulty figuring out what we are supposed to do since there is no easy tutorial on how to do everything (we especially know nothing about the coding part). I think it is very smart that we decided to make our car Wall-E themed. It will at least look good (hopefully). We started the CADs and did what we could while researching. We are planning to finish our physical car CAD (not our circuit one yet) next week.

            2/5/24 - Last week we did our arduino wiring. We also kind of started making the physical robot. This week, we are hoping to solder our wheels and finish the circuits. If we have time, we also want to work on our written document and start coding (with Mr. Poole's help). We also hope to make progress on the cardboard body of the robot. On Sunday, I went to see cats!!!! I went to a store that was having an adoption event and even got to hold a super cute white kitten. I also saw two round faced, round eyed kittens and they were soooo soft and cute.

            2/13/24 - Last week, we soldered our wheels. It was very fun. Mr. Poole helped us get our wheels moving a little. Kind of. We're not sure how to make them move when we want. We also cut the rest of the cardboard squares needed to make our Wall-E body cube. I hope my team can figure out how to code and make our car according to the plan.
