            1/19/24 - Happy New Year! Last week, we learned about chemical engineering and made Non-Newtonian Fluid. Ours was purple! It was quite fun. This week, we were introduced to our quarter project of creating cars. Jocelyn and I chose the Arduino car, and we are quite worried because neither of us know much about computer science or electrical engineering. We don't know how to go about it yet, but we are working on our project proposal and it is going well so far. We took the chemical engineering quiz today and I think I did good. We also made a new page for our second semester entries. My dog in the picture at the top died in November last year, so it's sad to look at the picture, but I will keep it.
