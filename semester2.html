            1/19/24 - Happy New Year! Last week, we learned about chemical engineering and made Non-Newtonian Fluid. Ours was purple! It was quite fun. This week, we were introduced to our quarter project of creating a car. Jocelyn and I chose the Arduino car, and we are quite worried because neither of us know much about computer science or electrical engineering. We don't know how to go about it yet, but we are working on our project proposal and it is going well so far. We took the chemical engineering quiz today and I think I did good. We also made a new page for our second semester entries.

            1/26/24 - This week we started our car project. We are having much difficulty figuring out what we are supposed to do since there is no easy tutorial on how to do everything (we especially know nothing about the coding part). I think it is very smart that we decided to make our car Wall-E themed. It will at least look good (hopefully). We started the CADs and did what we could while researching. We are planning to finish our physical car CAD (not our circuit one yet) next week.

            2/5/24 - Last week we did our arduino wiring. We also kind of started making the physical robot. This week, we are hoping to solder our wheels and finish the circuits. If we have time, we also want to work on our written document and start coding (with Mr. Poole's help). We also hope to make progress on the cardboard body of the robot. On Sunday, I went to see cats!!!! I went to a store that was having an adoption event and even got to hold a super cute white kitten. I also saw two round faced, round eyed kittens and they were soooo soft and cute.

            2/13/24 - Last week, we soldered our wheels. It was very fun. Mr. Poole helped us get our wheels moving a little. Kind of. We're not sure how to make them move when we want. We also cut the rest of the cardboard squares needed to make our Wall-E body cube. I hope my team can figure out how to code and make our car according to the plan.

            2/27/24 - My car was very cute. It was a cube with a walrus face. It moved dragging the back bottom edge of itself and in a box. It didn't break or anything when we tested it so I think it was quite successful. If we had more time, we could have made it better since we had so many setbacks that we wasted time on. The hardest part of making the car was that we couldn't figure out why certain things weren't working.

            3/4/24 - The goal of this project is to create a device that will stop an egg from shattering as it is dropped from a three story building. My group decided to make a device to put on the egg so it lands gently. There will be a lot of cushion so it doesn't crack. I am scared that the cushion will not be enough.. the fall will not be slowed by the device at all so it may be too fast and hard.

            3/13/24 - My egg drop did not go as planned... The boxes fell apart as they fell :(. Our egg, Eggward, did not break, but his chin got dented. We didn't have enough time/means to fully attach the sides of the boxes to each other. I ADOPTED TWO KITTENS!!! They are coming home tomorrow and ill spend my entire spring break with them!!!

            4/1/24 - We started a gutter boat project. We need to make a boat with certain maximum dimensions to get through a certain distance in the fastest time. We can push it with our breath. We are making a paper boat with a tissue sail. We hope it travels fast without tipping over. My favorite part of spring break was getting my cats and spending a day with them, but then I had to give them back and I had a breakdown. In the last quarter, I aim to do good on my AP exams and have As in all my classes.

            4/5/24 - These past two weeks we did our gutter boat project, making a boat out of limited materials to travel through a small gutter. Our boat went further than most other groups' boats, but it still only went a little bit of the 500 cm. We could have done that rubber band propellor thing that Mr. Poole showed us after. I will keep it in mind for the next time someone asks me to make a little boat with popsicle sticks and a rubber band. I loved doing any project with my friends (like the rube goldberg project), and the worst part of the class was doing projects with random people (like the business engineering project). This weekend, I will study and do homework as always... :(

            4/15/24 - Our new project is the carboard boat project. We have to make a big cardboard boat for two people to row across the school pool. I'm excited to make it and watch other people fall in the water. Last week, we had a challenge to make a post-it bridge as long as possible. I think my bridge was about 14 feet long. I am looking forward to summer break (until July 1st, when my summer school starts).

            4/26/24 - During the past two weeks, my group finished our CAD and made some of the boat. We used some cardboard and couldn't get more so we couldn't do that much, but we did plan out how we would make most of it. I'm scared that the boat will sink, but Emma seems confident in the design. I'm also unsure about how we will build some parts of it but I'm sure we will figure it out. I'm excited to keep working on the boat and seeing it get built, but not excited to get in it and maybe sink... People usually think I'm boring and have no personality until they know me better, so I want to seem more interesting.
