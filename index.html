            8/25/23 - I joined this class late, on Tuesday. I was also absent that day, so my first day was Wednesday. I signed into AWS Academy and learned how to get to Cloud9. On Thursday, I did the marble activity and, despite my team's efforts, we did not get the marble in the cup once. The activity really tested my patience.

            9/1/23 - This week I learned how to use Tinkercad. My group and I began brainstorming for our Rube Goldberg project. We sketched ideas on paper. On Challenge Day, we had a competition making home appliances on Tinkercad. I made a washing machine.

            9/8/23 - This week went okay. I had a lot of work from some of my classes. I learned better how to use Tinkercad and was able to use it comfortably afterwards. My group (Emma) was very ambitious with our project and decided to use all six of the machines. I think the most challenging part will be the screw.

            9/22/23 - Last week, my team worked on our Rube Goldberg machine:

            We had good communication and cooperation and were able to make it well, but the end part with the wedge failed to pop the balloon. We finished this week (Monday) and tested it, but it was ultimately unsuccessful and we popped Dan the Evil Man ourselves. If we had more time, we could have made it work; the only unsuccessful aspect was the final balloon popping. On Tuesday, we had a challenge where we had to create a device to float on water while carrying weight. We only had a sheet of paper to use, and in the end we learned that surface area is the most important factor and leaving the sheet of paper without modifying anything was the best way to go about it. On Wednesday, we had another challenge where we drew a capital E with measurements and made someone else's drawing with accurate measurements. It was quite easy and reaffirmed my belief that I could measure things correctly. On Thursday we learned about computer engineering. I learned that they have a good salary, and I have an interest in computers, so I am considering going into that field in the future.

            9/28/23 - On Monday, we worked on our computer engineering worksheets and fixed websites. I am interested in the computer science aspect of computer engineering (and the salary). On Tuesday, we took apart and put together a desktop computer and did a worksheet on that on Wednesday. I learned the structure and parts of the inside of a computer. This weekend, I dont have anything planned but homework.

            10/6/23 - I learned that bioengineering encompasses all other types of engineering. It uses various different types to create effective products for human use. My hand design used strings on the fingertips to pull them down. It worked a little and picked the bottle up a few times. I would change the thumb positioning and angle so it can more effectively pick the bottle up. I'm volunteering on Saturday and not going to homecoming.

            10/13/23 - I was not here to learn about Aerospace Engineering on Monday. Mr. Poole gave us a talk about our test scores and effort in the class on Thursday. The four forces on a flying object are weight, thrust, lift, and drag. I like that we don't have homework in this class.
