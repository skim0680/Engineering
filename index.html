            8/25/23 - I joined this class late, on Tuesday. I was also absent that day, so my first day was Wednesday. I signed into AWS Academy and learned how to get to Cloud9. On Thursday, I did the marble activity and, despite my team's efforts, we did not get the marble in the cup once. The activity really tested my patience.
